Certain industrial facilities in the U.S. must report annually how much of each chemical is recycled, combusted for energy recovery, treated for destruction, and disposed of or otherwise released on- and off-site. This information is collectively referred to as production-related waste managed.\r\n\r\nThis shapefile represent releases of TRI-covered chemicals to the environment in Oregon. A \"release\" of a chemical means that it is emitted to the air or water, placed in some type of land disposal, or transferred off-site for disposal or release.",
